## Executive Summary

### Critical Findings

ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL ISSUE: solarheim.ch NOT SET UP IN GOOGLE SEARCH CONSOLE**

- âœ“ **solarheim.com** property EXISTS and is verified in GSC
- âœ— **solarheim.ch** property DOES NOT EXIST in GSC
- âš  **solarheim.com** shows ZERO traffic data (no clicks, no impressions)

### Overall Health Status

**STATUS: INCOMPLETE MIGRATION - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

1. You have NO visibility into search performance for solarheim.ch
2. Google cannot communicate indexing issues or problems
3. You cannot submit sitemaps for the .ch domain
4. Search performance data is not being collected
5. You cannot monitor Core Web Vitals, mobile usability, or other critical metrics

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Property Status

#### solarheim.com (sc-domain:solarheim.com)
- **Status:** âœ“ Verified and accessible
- **Permission Level:** Site Owner
- **Service Account Access:** âœ“ Granted (full owner permissions)
- **Last Activity:** Property exists but shows no traffic data

#### solarheim.ch
- **Status:** âœ— NOT FOUND in Google Search Console
- **Issue:** Property has not been added to GSC, or service account lacks access

### 10. Historical Traffic Analysis

**Analysis Period:** Last 16 months (July 2024 - October 2025)

| Period | Clicks | Impressions | Status |
|--------|--------|-------------|--------|
| Last 7 days | 0 | 0 | No traffic |
| Last 28 days | 0 | 0 | No traffic |
| Last 90 days | 0 | 0 | No traffic |
| All available data | 0 | 0 | No historical data |

**Conclusion:** The solarheim.com property has no recorded traffic data in Google Search Console. This suggests either:
1. The property was created but never actively used
2. Historical data was purged or not available
3. The site migrated to .ch before GSC tracking began
4. GSC API data retention limits apply

## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### PRIORITY 1: Add solarheim.ch to Google Search Console

**Issue:** Primary domain not monitored
**Impact:** Complete lack of SEO visibility
**Urgency:** IMMEDIATE

**Actions Required:**
1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. Click "Add Property"
3. Select "Domain" property type
4. Enter: solarheim.ch
5. Verify ownership using DNS TXT record (recommended method)
6. Wait for verification to complete

### PRIORITY 2: Grant Service Account Access

**Issue:** Automated reporting cannot access solarheim.ch
**Impact:** Cannot generate this type of analysis for the live site
**Urgency:** IMMEDIATE

**Actions Required:**
1. After adding solarheim.ch property, go to Settings > Users and permissions
2. Click "Add user"
3. Enter email: `gsc-automation@websites-473902.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
4. Select permission level: "Owner"
5. Click "Add"

### PRIORITY 3: Verify 301 Redirects from .com to .ch

**Issue:** Need to confirm proper domain migration
**Impact:** SEO equity transfer, user experience
**Urgency:** HIGH

**Actions Required:**
1. Test that all solarheim.com URLs redirect to solarheim.ch equivalents
2. Verify redirect type is 301 (permanent)
3. Ensure redirect preserves URL structure (e.g., /page-name stays /page-name)
4. Check that www and non-www versions both redirect properly
5. Test with multiple pages, not just homepage

**Testing Command:**
```bash
curl -I https://solarheim.com
curl -I https://www.solarheim.com
curl -I https://solarheim.com/some-product-page
```

Look for: `HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently` and `Location: https://solarheim.ch/...`

### PRIORITY 4: Submit Sitemaps for solarheim.ch

**Issue:** No sitemaps submitted for the active domain
**Impact:** Slower indexing, incomplete crawling
**Urgency:** HIGH

**Actions Required (after solarheim.ch is added to GSC):**
1. Generate fresh XML sitemaps for solarheim.ch
2. Submit via GSC: Sitemaps section
3. Expected sitemaps:
   - https://solarheim.ch/sitemap_index.xml (or)
   - https://solarheim.ch/page-sitemap.xml
   - https://solarheim.ch/product-sitemap.xml
   - https://solarheim.ch/product_cat-sitemap.xml

## Confirmation on Domain Switch Issues

### Has the .com to .ch switch caused problems?

**Answer: Cannot fully determine without access to solarheim.ch GSC data**

However, based on current analysis:

**Concerning Indicators:**
- âœ— solarheim.ch not set up in GSC (major oversight)
- âœ— No monitoring capability for the live domain
- âš  Potential that Google hasn't fully discovered the migration

**Neutral/Positive Indicators:**
- âœ“ solarheim.com shows no traffic (suggests successful redirect)
- âœ“ Old property still exists (historical data preserved)
- âš  Zero indexing on old domain (expected after migration)

**What we don't know (requires .ch access):**
- Is solarheim.ch being indexed?
- How many pages are in Google's index?
- Is search traffic flowing to .ch?
- Are there any indexing errors?
- What is the current ranking position?
- Are users finding the site in search?

### Migration Success Criteria

To confirm a successful migration, we need to see (once .ch is added):

âœ“ **Index Status**
- 80%+ of important pages indexed
- Low error rate (< 5%)
- No major coverage issues

âœ“ **Traffic Recovery**
- Organic traffic at 70-100% of pre-migration levels
- Trend showing recovery within 3-6 months
- No major ranking drops for key terms

âœ“ **Technical Health**
- No redirect chains
- All redirects are 301 (permanent)
- Fast page load times
- Good Core Web Vitals scores

âœ“ **Search Visibility**
- Brand searches find the .ch site
- Key landing pages ranking well
- Site: search shows .ch pages, not .com
