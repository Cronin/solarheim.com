# Executive Summary: Solarheim GSC Analysis
## Critical Domain Migration Issue Identified

**Date:** October 28, 2025
**Site:** solarheim.ch (primary), solarheim.com (legacy)
**Status:** üö® **URGENT ACTION REQUIRED**

---

## The Problem

**solarheim.ch is NOT set up in Google Search Console**

This means you have **zero visibility** into:
- Search performance (clicks, impressions, rankings)
- Indexing status (how many pages Google has indexed)
- Technical issues (errors, mobile problems, security)
- Core Web Vitals (site speed and user experience)
- Manual actions or penalties

**In simple terms:** You're flying blind with your SEO.

## What We Found

### ‚úì What's Working
1. **solarheim.com property exists** in GSC (but shows no traffic)
2. **Service account is authenticated** and can access the .com property
3. **Old sitemaps were submitted** (Dec 2023) for .com domain
4. **No traffic on .com** suggests migration to .ch has occurred

### ‚úó What's Broken
1. **solarheim.ch is NOT in Google Search Console** ‚Üê CRITICAL
2. **Service account has no access** to .ch property (because it doesn't exist)
3. **Cannot verify indexing status** for the live site
4. **Cannot monitor search performance** for the active domain
5. **Cannot submit sitemaps** for the current site

---

## Impact Assessment

### SEVERITY: **HIGH** üö®

**Immediate Impact:**
- No search performance data for your live site
- Cannot identify indexing problems

**Business Impact:**

**Risk Level:**
- If there ARE indexing issues, you won't know about them
- If traffic is declining, you won't see it until it's severe
- If Google issues a manual penalty, you won't be notified
